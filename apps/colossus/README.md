# Colossus

This is main framework repo.

All relevant information can be found in `Thor` docs, and in another docs under this umbrella project.

## Installation

We hope, that someday **Colossus** will be [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/packages/colossus), so the package can be installed
by adding `colossus` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:colossus, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/colossus](https://hexdocs.pm/colossus).]
